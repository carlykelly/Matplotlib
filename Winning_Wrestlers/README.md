# Pandas

The project in this folder was an assignment completed for The George Washington University Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp.

The Winning_Wrestlers ipynb files take four seperate csvs that were scraped down from a wrestling database, merge them together, and then create charts to visualize a wrestler's wins and losses over the course of four years.

Each activity in this folder builds off the other. `Winning_Wrestlers_Part3.ipynb` is the culmination of all three parts.
